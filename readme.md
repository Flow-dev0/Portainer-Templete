# Portainer Templetes 
### Intended for use on Portainer v2

I really love portainer and the functionality & ease of use it provides but the default templete it comes with is rather lackluster in terms of meeting the requirements of the average joe. 3rd party templetes on the other hand i personally feel are overloaded with things that you less likely to use. So this is my attempt at trying to resolve both of those issues.

**Incase you unfirmilar with portainer templetes  and not exactly sure about what you should do with this, dont stress.  Start by opening up your portainer admin panel.**
1. Click on "Settings" in the left menu panel.
2. Look for "App templetes" on the right side.
3. Copy and paste this link into the "URL" section.
 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flow-dev0/Portainer-Templete/main/template.json`

4. Hit save.
5. You done, Now go to the "App Templete section" on the left menu panel and you should see a refreshed list of apps for you to try.
